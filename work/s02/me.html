<p style="color:white;"><img src="resources/images/face.png" alt="Smiley face" align="right" height="229" width="264"> Hello. My name is [REDACTED]. I am 24 years old and I study software development at [REDACTED]. I am currently on my third year. <br><br> I live in [REDACTED], which is a small city in [REDACTED]. I have a few hobbies, such as videogames and boardgames. When it comes to video games, I enjoy a mix of competetive and casual games, depending on my mood. I am currently playing through the original xcom - ufo defense on veteran difficulity. When it comes to boardgames, my favorite is Red Dragon Inn, which is an amazing party game. I also enjoy collecting and playing TCG's. At the moment, I am currently playing Magic the Gathering, which I usually do at [REDACTED] every weekend. <br><br> I can be reached on email at [REDACTED]. Please send any feedback on this website there. I can also be reached through phone at [REDACTED], but only during the weekends</p>
