<p><b>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</b>
<br>
<i>I had a limited knowledge before this introduction. We have used github before in previous courses as our mandatory version control. I have not used Git in the sense of console but rather relied on the GitHub Desktop App before this. I had never heard of Github Pages before this. I have used markdown before, as Discord, for example supports it.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Have you ever created websites before?</b>
<br>
<i>We have used html for web services, but that was a single lab. I have never created proper a webpage before.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</b>
<br>
<i>My knowledge of web development is very limited. I have had brief experience with web services in the past. I have done a little bit of Javascript. I would say that my knowledge is not within web application development, but just network technology briefly touching on the subject.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
<i>Today I learned about GitHub Pages. I never knew this existed, despite using GitHub for a long time. I had always wanted to try and make a dashboard for my Discord bot that I made to compete with the successful and in my opinion terribly coded bot Dynobot. I find that, while not a permanent solution, that GitHub pages would be an excellent to test this out. I also further developed my knowledge with Git console commands. I did not know about tags before this.

    <p><b>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</b>
      <br>
      <i>We've had previous courses which have touched on HTML, but only very briefly. CSS has been part of many things, however, I've avoided it as it's been largely optional for most projects we have done. We did not, however, receive any real teaching on it either. I have used Javascript previously, as I developed a Discord bot for a community, using Node and their API. I have read documentation beforehand on it, as I had an interest to learn.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</b>
      <br>
      <i>HTML provides the requested resource, and presents it to the user. CSS controls the visual aspect of the presentation. Javascript makes the website dynamic, influencing the elements provided by the HTML. Together, all of these present what we know as a modern website, on a basic level at any rate.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</b>
      <br>
      <i>Browser requests the documents through the HTTP Protocol, from the web server. It downloads and represents these to the user. This also includes any resources required.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
      <i>I'm unsure if I learnt much in this part, as we're mostly starting out so far. Perhaps I learnt a bit about CSS, but most of these concepts are familiar to me, even if the implementation may be new. I have had an interest in Javascript, so learning a bit more of the basics is good. I also learnt that programming languages may be widely different, but working with them gives a sense of familiarity</i>

    <p><b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</b>
      <br>
      <i>No, I do not have any experience with client side JS. However, with the little JS experience I have it was fairly easy to pick up. Most of the fundamental knowledge of programming still applies here, making it easier to understand.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</b>
      <br>
      <i>It's hard to compare languages, especially when we have not worked with many in the past. I would like to say that it is similar in terms of writing to Java, more than I expected. I feel like it's easier to pick Javascript up, even though it's fundamentally different, to for example C# which is supposedly more similar to Java. I think the hardest part to grasp for me was using JSON, as it has always confused me when I started out with JS. The strangest part would be the variable declaration, as it is very different. Working with arrays are extremely similar, maybe even easier in JS due to these things.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</b>
      <br>
      <i>I approached with a minimal-effort mentality, as I did not have the energy to put the effort in. I was told that the online API would not work, and as such I did not spend time trying it, but rather using the JSON file. I aimed for grade 3, as I procrastinated and waited until the last moment to finish all of the Assignments. My code is basic, but it does the job. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
      <i>As the main part was the fetch(), I feel like I learnt a lot about getting and reading JSON responses. It also gave me an idea on some of the projects I've had lined up, as they could benefit from this too. I also gained more knowledge of CSS, and how to manipulate it through Javascript. </i>

    <p><b>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</b>
      <br>
      <i>Like in previous reports, my only experience with Node beforehand would be the Discord bot that I developed. It was developed also using Discord.js. It was has many features developed to be competetive with Dyno Bot, a very successful bot earning a large amount of money. It's other function was to provide any missing features that the community it was developed for was missing. These included a functioning mute, as their permission system did not work correctly with other bots. It replaced about 3 bots, but had to unfortunately be cancelled last year. Ironically, the reason for this was that I had to focus on my studies. After this course, I'm hoping to pick up development of it again.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</b>
      <br>
      <i>Javascript and I have a hate-love relationship. There are many features that I love about it, but many that I hate. Some of these may come from the fact that I did not have access to Web Storm as my IDE, which I find easier to work in than Atom. I don't really have any opinion on Node. Express is not too hard to work with, but I did find some features confusing. Express routes was probably the hardest part to grasp.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</b>
      <br>
      <i>Like most times, I looked at the /examples folder to gain an idea of what to do. I did not really plan anything, but just did it. The assignments, in my opinion, are a bit too small to justify planning beforehand. I helped some other students with the lotto part, so I knew how to do that before I started it. It all worked well, with a very minimalistic approach. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</b>
      <i>I aimed for grade 3 because I am lazy. It was easy.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
      <br>
      <i>Express was the new thing in this for me. I felt like it wasn't that difficult to learn once you got the hang of it. Other than that, it was mostly on a basic level. </i>

    <h2 id="report5">S05</h2>
    <p><b>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</b>
      <br>
      <i>I do not like it. I find it hard to work with, confusing and unlike anything I have worked with. However, like most programming languages, there is always the sense of familiarity. With PHP, this feeling was more an annoyance than help. It feels like someone took the most confusing parts of Java and Javascript and merged them, just to annoy me. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</b>
      <br>
      <i>I cannot. It does not feel like any specific language, and more like a dumb mixture of many others. This is probably due to how much Java we have used in the past.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</b>
      <br>
      <i>I took it on with a lot of pain. I did not enjoy it, which made the exercise go a lot slower than I would have liked. I aimed for grade 3, for the same reasons as previous reports. As for the results, I am glad it is over and finished. In terms of quality, due to how little fun I had with it, I do not care for the finished quality. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
      <i>I learnt that I despise PHP. I also learnt that I will have to learn it at some point anyways for my future career choices, so getting some basics in now is a good thing.</i>

    <p><b>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</b>
      <br>
      <i>I think that Java will continue to be very popular. I think Python will fall off in popularity. I do not know about C based languages. HTML is a necessity, until a replacement comes out. Javascript will continue to be the choice of online ones. It all depends on what technology gets released, and their purpose.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</b>
      <br>
      <i>I have the most experience with Java, so that feels like a natural choice. Javascript for web. I think that Python will fall off, so I do not think that would be my choice. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</b>
      <br>
      <i>Java used to be more popular than it is now, but it is still very popular. Kotlin, despite google switching over to it for mobile development, remains largely unknown. HTML and PHP appear to be steady, but low in terms of searches. Python has sky-rocked in popularity, with no indication that it's stopping. Javascript follows mostly the same trend. C is not very popular, but more than Kotlin. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</b>
      <br>
      <i>Python due to it's popularity. Or Java/Javascript on their steady popularity.</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
      <i>I learned that Python is more popular than I expected, and that kotlin is largely unknown.</i>

    <p><b>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</b>
      <br>
      <i>.NET is a platform created by Microsoft. C# is fairly similar to other object oriented languages. It feels like it's more structured than other similar Technologies, in my opinion at any rate. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</b>
      <br>
      <i>It felt very similar to the Node.JS work that we did previously, but more structured. Other than that, it was fairly different. Like many of the techniques we use, the end goal is to make a web page. </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</b>
      <br>
      <i>For a long time I put this exercise off, not wanting to do it. I never really step outside of my comfort zone that is Java, so picking up another language felt like a very daunting task. I used the examples provided, which did make it easier to understand. It was also a lot like a previous course we had done. In there, however, we used Java. I aimed for Grade 3, as I waited until the last moment to do most of the assignments and I did not have the energy to invest with the project, degree thesis and life dragging me down. As I only aimed for a passing grade, I am satisfied with the results. It isn't very creative but it works.  </i>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What is your TIL for this course section?</b>
      <i>Once you get over the initial hurdle, C# isn't that strange. If given a few more weeks to play around with it, I don't think I'd have an issue programming in it, much like I do in Java.  </i>
